Inspired by ``requests`` for its simplicity and powered by ``lxml`` for its speed; **newspaper**
is a Python 2 library for extracting & curating articles from the web.

Newspaper utilizes lxml and caching for speed. *Also, everything is in unicode :)*

There are two API's available. Low level ``article`` objects and ``source`` objects
generated by the newsaper module.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import newspaper

    >>> cnn_paper = newspaper.build('http://cnn.com') # takes ~10 seconds

    >>> for article in cnn_paper.articles: 
    >>>     print article.url

    u'http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/27/justice/tucson-arizona-captive-girls/'
    u'http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/11/us/texas-teen-dwi-wreck/index.html'
    u'http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/07/us/life-pearl-harbor/'
    ...

    # numb of articles extracted and cached
    >>> print cnn_paper.size() 
    3100 

    # categories & feeds are cached for a day (adjustable) 
    >>> print cnn_paper.category_urls() 
    [u'http://lifestyle.cnn.com', u'http://cnn.com/world', u'http://tech.cnn.com' ...]

    >>> print cnn_paper.feed_urls()  
    [u'http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_crime.rss', u'http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_tech.rss', ...] 
    

    #### build articles, then download, parse, and perform NLP 
    >>> for article in cnn_paper.articles[:5]:
         article.download() 

    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[0].html
    u'<!DOCTYPE HTML><html itemscope itemtype="http://...'
    
    # won't work, we only downloaded 5 articles
    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[7].html 
    u'' 


    ### parse an article for it's body text, top image, authors, and title
    >>> cnn_paper.articles[0].parse() # just one article this time

    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[0].text
    u'Three sisters who were imprisoned for possibly...'

    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[0].top_img  
    u'http://some.cdn.com/3424hfd4565sdfgdg436/

    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[0].authors
    [u'Eliott C. McLaughlin', u'Some CoAuthor']
    
    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[0].title
    u'Police: 3 sisters imprisoned in Tucson home'


    #### extract nlp (must be on an already parsed article
    >>> cnn_paper.articles[0].nlp()

    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[0].summary
    u'...imprisoned for possibly a constant barrage...'

    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[0].keywords
    [u'music', u'Tucson', ... ]

    # now try nlp() on an article that hasen't been downloaded
    >>> print cnn_paper.articles[100].nlp()
    Traceback (...
       ...
    ArticleException: You must parse an article before you try to nlpify is


    #### some other news-source level functionality
    >>> print cnn_paper.brand
    u'cnn'

    >>> print cnn_paper.description
    u'CNN.com delivers the latest breaking news and information on the latest...'


###IMPORTANT 
    
Unless told not to in the constructor via the ``is_memo_articles`` param (default true), 
newspaper automatically caches all category, feed, and article urls. 
This is both to avoid duplicate articles and for speed.

.. code-block:: pycon

    # Suppose the above code has been run on the cnn domain, (our 2nd run).
    >>> import newspaper

    >>> cnn_paper = newspaper.build('http://cnn.com')
    >>> cnn_paper.size()
    60 
    # indicates that since we last ran build(), cnn has published 60 new articles!


    # If you'd like to opt out of memoization, init your newspapers with
    >>> cnn_paper2 = newspaper.build('http://cnn.com', is_memo=False)


Alternatively, you may use newspaper's lower level Article api.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from newspaper import Article

    >>> article = Article('http://cnn.com/2013/11/27/travel/weather-thanksgiving/index.html')
    >>> article.download()

    >>> print article.html 
    u'<!DOCTYPE HTML><html itemscope itemtype="http://...'
    
    >>> article.parse()

    >>> print article.text
    u'The purpose of this article is to introduce...'

    >>> print article.authors
    [u'Martha Stewart', u'Bob Smith']

    >>> print article.top_img
    u'http://some.cdn.com/3424hfd4565sdfgdg436/

    >>> print article.title
    u'Thanksgiving Weather Guide Travel ...'

    >>> article.nlp()
           
    >>> print article.summary
    u'...and so that's how a Thanksgiving meal is cooked...'

    >>> print article.keywords
    [u'Thanksgiving', u'holliday', u'Walmart', ...]

``nlp()`` is expensive, as is ``parse()``, make sure you actually need them before calling them on
all of your articles! In some cases, if you just need urls, even ``download()`` is not necessary.
