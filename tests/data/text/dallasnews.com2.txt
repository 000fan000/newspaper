There is a caste system already in football with potential performance measured up front by the Wonderlic test. It ranges from quarterbacks in the 30 range (Romo 37 and Stafford 38 which is right up there with engineers and chemists) to single digits in other positions which rank below janitors at 14. There was even a study which indicated that the higher the score was for some positions, the less desirable they may be for draft purposes.

Football is just one of the ways we are no longer the country we once were. We just lost an orthopedic surgeon named Jimmy Swink who was a TCU All American in the days getting a college scholarship meant getting an education a lot of other people wouldn’t get. College football has since evolved into an NFL farm team model where attending class is an unfortunate, mind numbing byproduct you and your mentor just have to put up with to stay on the team.

We have achieved Rome’s greatness with the military machine, highways, architecture, government, and of course the bread and circuses. TANF, EBT, Section 8, Free Cell Phones, Obamacare, et al gives us the Bread and Football and MMA the gladiators. You don’t have to read up on Gibbon to see the parallels between the Decline phase of the first superpower and the process currently underway within the former superpower.
