Going simple is the best decorating solution for fall centerpieces and table toppers. Here, deeply hued roses and dahlias play off the more muted collection of faux tomatoes and fall foliage. Editor's Tip: Choose a vase color that recedes and doesn't compete with the blooms.

Without carved faces, pumpkins make a dramatic tabletop. Start with lengths of grapevine wrapped around and up and down pumpkins in different patterns. Display smaller gourds under glass and scatter a base of leaves underneath, and include a tall vase filled with wheat or dried lavender for subtle color complement.

It's easy to craft a no-sew table runner in the shapes and colors of fall. Find and enlarge a fallen leaf shape and cut it out from a piece of felt. Glue ribbon or single-fold bias tape to the edge and place on a contrasting piece of felt or complementary table runner.

These colorful vegetables are the perfect fall tabletop decorations when stuffed with flowers and foliage. Cut each pepper lengthwise an inch from the top to make an opening (don't cut the top completely off), hollow out the pepper and fill with different types of flowers. Set the peppers on small plates to finish the decoration.

Inexpensive tools make this uniquely carved pumpkin easy to recreate. Use a large leaf to trace onto a pumpkin and use a scraping tool to cut away only the outermost layer. Set it on a bed of moss and a pedestal for a centerpiece that will last all season.

The vibrant, diverse colors of Indian corn perfectly represent the color palette of fall, and you can put them to use in a no-fuss candleholder. Place a candle at the center and hot-glue corncobs together in a circle around it to make this pretty tabletop decoration.

Pumpkins typically are front and center at doorways and on tables, but this elegant collection of corn and wheat stalks fits in perfectly with the season. Include a variety of colors of corn and a few different sizes and include an individual cob at each place setting.

Small gourds and pumpkins are nearly sculptural, and a cluster of two or three on a pretty plain plate resembles a still life. Tuck in a pinecone and a few leaves, and wrap a bit of raffia or twine around one of the stems.

This decorative arrangement of cattails, pheasant feathers (found at crafts stores), and Purple Majesty ornamental millet doesn't need water, so it will last all season long. Editor's Tip: Place chicken wire or floral netting inside an urn to create structure within the vase. Mold the wire into a ball to fit the bottom of the vase and stick the stems into the holes to complete the arrangement.

Pumpkins like the ones pictured can be used as decorations all season long. Elevate a few -- chosen for the beauty of their contrasting colors -- on a pedestal. Underneath, use a table runner or cloth that picks up on the hues, and tuck in few bittersweet branches for texture.

Repetition of color -- whether with pumpkins, foliage, or flowers -- creates a unified fall decorating scheme that accents all of fall's bounty. Dominant tones of orange and yellow are present in a vase of blooms and a cluster of branches on a sideboard, in addition to the main pumpkin display.
