The raven-haired gal bares a striking resemblance to a former Bachelorette who may have broken Chris’s heart last season, with her shiny locks and sparkling eyes. So, what else makes her perfect for Prince Farming? Read on, gentle reader. The 24-year-old from Hamilton, New Jersey was likely the quickest packer of the 30 gals cast on The Bachelor 2015, as she works as a flight attendant. Unfortunately for her, producers sent the lucky ladies on a bizarre tour of ‘Merica rather than letting them dip their toes into foreign oceans. When Alissa isn’t flying the friendly skies, she keeps her head on her shoulders with “family, friends, laughter, hope, and faith,” according to her official ABC bio. Should you want to hop aboard her social media flight, you’re a bit outta luck. Miss Alissa’s Facebook is currently deactivated, and you’ll need a boarding pass to her Instagram, as it’s set to private. Her LinkedIn is also seemingly out of date, as it says she works for Gallo Winery. Needless to say, that job likely gave her the skills needed to hang tough for the hours of drinking before rose ceremonies. Girlfriend keeps it limber between flights with her love of yoga, and she even earned a certificate in being bendy. Let’s hope things work out with Herr Soules, because they might get a touch awkward if not — Alissa says her greatest fear is running into recent exes. She even admits that she once stalked a crush hardcore — and then texted him her findings on accident. Yikes. But just in case you’re wondering, Alissa made the Dean’s List at St. Joseph’s, where she studied business. To sum her up, let’s turn to the gal’s description of her spirit animal: “A wild mustang. Free to run and explore, they're unpredictable and beautiful, and are loyal to their herd.” If that’s not a winning Bachelor contestant, we don’t know who is. Do you think Alissa is Chris’ perfect match? Sound off in the comments below. Sources: Reality Steve, ABC, LinkedIn
