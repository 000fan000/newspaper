The holidays come with many positives – families, no work, copious amounts of cheese (literally, eating it and the corny movies variety) – but they also come with a lot of naughtiness. When I say naughtiness, I don’t mean kids unwrapping their pressies early. I mean the parties where everyone is obliterated and mauling one another (with a wedding ring on their finger). Last week, I was sat in the local as an office party was going on beside me and my mates, just minding our own biz. Then a lad, about 25, sits down on the stool next to us before a rather trollied lass plonked her unsteady behind down on his knee. They were both slurring their words when we overheard the girl say, "Weeeell, you've got a girlfriend and I'm not single, but so what?!" Lovely. I especially loved her discretion, slap bang in the middle of the pub. She's basically got a wide-on over another guy while her other half was probably at home stuffing the turkey. Stats show that cheating increases at this time of year, instead of secret Santa we have the secret s***gers too. Jokes aside, I think it's disgusting. The classic excuse, 'it meant nothing'. Well, that's more of a f***ing insult! If someone is going to cheat, there must be some feelings or strong attraction, surely. Another lame backtrack is blaming dropping your chinos or lifting your skirt on being drunk.

I don’t understand how anyone in their right mind gets THAT wasted that they don’t know what they're doing. Coming from someone who every time they go out they get sloshed, I still don’t wake up the next morning thinking, 'Oh my God, who have I slept with?' I've also never woken up after a night out thinking, 'S**t, did I s**g someone behind my partner's back last night?' I think if I ever did wake up after doing that, I'd give up alcohol altogether and reassess my morals. Alcohol is just used as an excuse, b*****ks do people only get these urges to cheat when under the influence. If you're going to cheat, you'll do it sober or drunk. Despite the trolls (who really should make getting out more their primary new year resolution) blasting me with 'You can't talk, homewrecker/s**g/blah blah' – I CAN talk. My views on cheating are extremely strong and always have been. Yeah, I've done my fair share of messing around and one-night stands, but I was never hurting anyone. When I was younger, it didn’t really bother me if I knew a guy had a girlfriend, if I didn’t know the girl, it didn’t effect me. That was my opinion at the time.

Since getting older, my feelings have changed. I think if I gave my number out knowing that the lad has a chick, it'll bite me back on the a**e at some point in life. Although I've been the girl to cheat with men that are occupied, I'd never be able to do that myself. Having found cheap eyelashes, texts and lip-glosses in and around my ex’s things, it didn’t take a genius to work out what he’d been up to. Let's just say I've put that one to bed now.

If I felt in any way sexual towards another guy, and I don’t mean looking at a fittie in a bar, it's time to leave. Wanting to bed another man clearly means my current partner is not the one I want to have sex with for the rest of my life – SO WHAT IS THE POINT IN BEING THERE?! One thing that actually grates on me, is when a couple 'move on' from cheating: how the f**k do you move on? I don’t care if it's texting, kissing, s***ging whatever, it's all still cheating. A text usually leads to sex, otherwise why else do people do this? You don’t start the ball rolling for a hot chocolate in Starbucks.
