YAMHILL COUNTY -- The Yamhill County Sheriff's Office Project Lifesaver Team is the recipient of a bi-annual grant from the Alzheimer's Foundation of America for $5,000.

This grant will enhance the current Project Lifesaver Program by upgrading certain equipment and providing up to 15 new transmitters for new clients.

The Yamhill County Sheriff's Office and the Yamhill County Sheriff's Search and Rescue started Project Lifesaver in Yamhill County in 2007 thanks to many donations from both private individuals and organizations.

The primary mission of Project Lifesaver is to provide timely response to save lives and reduce potential injury for adults and children who wander due to Alzheimer's, autism, and other related conditions or disorders. The program consists of a bracelet transmitter, which is place on a client's wrist or ankle, and a specialized receiver that the Project Lifesaver team uses to track the specific radio frequency that the transmitter emits on a constant basis.

The Project Lifesaver Team is made up of volunteers from the Search and Rescue Team along with deputies who are trained on locating the clients and how to deal with the clients once they are located. Once a month, a member of the team visits the clients to change batteries and bands that hold the transmitter in place.

Project Lifesaver aids Search and Rescue in reducing time searching for a client that goes missing. To date they have been 100 percent in finding clients who left their homes. Generally the searches last under 10 minutes once the team is on scene. Yamhill County has had 19 searches since 2007 for clients on the Project Lifesaver program. Project Lifesaver is provided free of charge to Yamhill County residents.
