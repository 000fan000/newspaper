Pauline Cafferkey, a Scottish nurse, arrived at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, for specialist treatment at the infectious diseases unit this morning.

Ms Cafferkey returned to Scotland after working in the west African country and arrived on a British Airways flight at Glasgow airport at around 11.30pm on Sunday.

She has been a nurse for 16 years and was volunteering for Save The Children when she contracted the deadly virus.

Ms Cafferkey was said to be displaying no symptoms on the plane and the risk to other patients is said to be "low".

Public health officials are said to be looking to contact passengers who sat adjacent to the nurse as a precautionary approach.

Meanwhile, another person is being tested in north west Scotland for the virus but is said to be "low risk".

Another patient, in Truro, Cornwall, has been placed in isolation and is also being tested for Ebola.

The Scottish nurse was admitted to hospital early on Monday after feeling unwell. She is in a stable condition.

She was accompanied to hospital by a convoy of ambulances and police cars as workers wore full protective suits.

A tent has been set up around her bed so the infection can be contained while she is treated.

The unit in London successfully treated British nurse WIlliam Pooley who was flown home from Sierra Leone in August after contracting the virus.
