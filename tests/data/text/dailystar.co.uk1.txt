The Scottish nurse arrived at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, for specialist treatment at the infectious diseases unit, surrounded by a convoy of ambulances and police cars.

The woman returned to Scotland after working in the west African country and arrived on a British Airways flight at Glasgow airport at around 11.30pm on Sunday.

The patient – who is understood to have been volunteering for Save The Children – was said to be displaying no symptoms on the plane and the risk to other patients is said to be "low".

Public health officials are said to be looking to contact passengers who sat adjacent to the nurse as a precautionary approach.

Meanwhile, another person is being tested in north west Scotland for the deadly virus but is said to be "low risk".

Another patient, in Truro, Cornwall, has been placed in isolation and is also being tested for Ebola.

The Scottish nurse was admitted to hospital early on Monday after feeling unwell. She is in a stable condition.

She was accompanied to hospital by a convoy of ambulances and police cars as workers wore full protective suits.

A tent has been set up around her bed so the infection can be contained while she is treated.

The unit in London successfully treated British nurse WIlliam Pooley who was flown home from Sierra Leone in August after contracting the virus.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "Our first thoughts at this time must be with the patient diagnosed with Ebola and their friends and family. I wish them a speedy recovery.

"Scotland has been preparing for this possibility from the beginning of the outbreak in West Africa and I am confident that we are well prepared.

"We have the robust procedures in place to identify cases rapidly. Our health service also has the expertise and facilities to ensure that confirmed Ebola cases such as this are contained and isolated effectively minimising any potential spread of the disease.

"Scotland’s NHS has proved it is well able to cope with infectious diseases in the past, such as swine flu, and I am confident we will be able to respond effectively again.”

She has also spoken to Prime Minister David Cameron.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who chaired an emergency Cobra meeting, vowed the Government was doing "absolutely everything" to keep the public safe.

"We are reviewing our procedures and protocols for the other NHS workers who are working in Sierra Leone alongside colleagues from the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office," he said.

"They are doing a very, very brave job, under very challenging circumstances.

"We want to make absolutely sure that we are doing everything we can to keep them safe.

"The clinical advice is that the risk is very low to other passengers. She wasn't exhibiting feverish symptoms.

"The process has worked well because the moment she did exhibit those symptoms we were able to take her into isolation."

A British Airways spokesman said: "We are working closely with the health authorities in England and Scotland and will offer assistance with any information they require.

"Customers who flew from London Heathrow to Glasgow on BA1478 which departed at 2100 on Sunday December 28 and have concerns should contact the special number 08000 858531 set up by the Scottish Government.

"The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low."

The current Ebola outbreak, which began in West Africa, is the largest epidemic of the virus in history.

It began in Guinea in December 2013 and quickly spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone – the two worst-affected nations.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported a total of 19,980 suspected cases and 7,793 deaths.

But the WHO believes these figures understate the true size of the deadly outbreak.

Earlier this month Time magazine named those healthcare workers who have travelled to help with the crisis as their "Person of the Year".
