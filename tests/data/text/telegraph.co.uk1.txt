09.06 Further confirmation from Reuters:
Debris sighted in Indonesia's Java Sea is from the AirAsia jet presumed to have crashed two days ago, Tatang Zaenudin, an official at the country's search and rescue agency, told Reuters on Tuesday.
09.03 REUTERS - INDONESIA RESCUE AND SEARCH AGENCY OFFICIAL SAYS JAVA SEA DEBRIS IS FROM MISSING AIRASIA JET
08.46 The transcript of the final communication between air-traffic control and the pilot of AirAsia Flight 8501 has been released.
According to The New York Post, It reveals a calm request to redirect the plane and then to climb to avoid a storm.
Air-traffic control couldn’t say yes immediately because six other planes were crowding the higher airspace, forcing Flight 8501 to remain at a lower altitude, the transcript reveals.
By the time the pilot was given the OK, a mere two minutes later, it was apparently too late - there was no response from the cockpit.
Indonesia’s state navigation operator said late Monday that the Airbus 320-200 pilot, Capt. Iriyanto, who goes by one name, had requested permission to turn left to avoid a storm.
The request was granted and the plane turned left for seven miles.
The captain then sent his fateful message at 6:12 a.m., saying, “Request to higher level,” according to AirNav Standards and Safety Director Wisnu Darjono, as quoted by the Jakarta Post.
“Intended to what level?” the controller responded. When Iriyanto said 38,000 feet, he was told to hold off because there were six other planes in that area.
“But when we informed the pilot of the approval at 6:14 a.m., we received no reply,” Wisnu said.
08.41 The Jakarta Post quotes a co-pilot of the Air Force Hercules C130, who flew on Tuesday over waters near Pangkalan Bun in Central Kalimantan in the search for missing AirAsia flight QZ8501.
Lt. Tri Wibowo said that he saw dozens of floating bodies as well as bags and aircraft debris.
QuoteWe thought that the passengers were still alive and waved at us for help. But when we approached closer [we saw] they were already dead.
Tri and the team scoured the area at around 11 a.m.
The Transportation Ministry earlier confirmed that white and red debris found near Pangkalan Bun belonged to the ill-fated flight, which vanished on Sunday en route to Singapore from Indonesia's second-biggest city of Surabaya in East Java.
08.38 Tony Fernandes, the boss of AirAsia said his heart was "filled with sadness" after several bodies were found floating in the sea near where a missing AirAsia flight was last seen.
Earlier, an Indonesia National Search and Rescue spokesman said several pieces of debris seen floating off Borneo might be linked to the missing Flight 8501.
Mr Fernandes, the AirAsia chief executive, said
QuoteMy heart is filled with sadness. Words cannot express how sorry I am. On behalf of AirAsia, my condolences to all. Words cannot express how sorry I am.

08.15 Plane spots 'shadow' on seabed believed to be AirAsia jet: Indonesia search chief
08.10 The Telegraph will not be publishing the images of the victims. The Indonesian search agency chief says the six bodies are swollen but intact and have been transferred to a navy ship.
08.08 As if it couldn't get worse for the families:
08.00 What we know at the moment:
- Items resembling emergency slide, life jackets, plane door and luggage spotted six miles from last point of contact
- Bodies have been spotted by search planes
- 11 divers heading to the debris area
- the waters are warm and relatively shallow at 80ft so teams are holding out hope for surviors
- Officials say they are 95 per cent sure items are from the missing Airbus
- Distraught relatives have been broken the news
07.52 Jonathan Pearlman, our correspondent at the press conference in Jakarta, says Indonesia's search authority has confirmed a body has been found in the water along with debris confirmed to be from the missing Air Asia plane. Indonesia's TV One has shown a rather gruesome photo of one body floating in water.
Henry Bambang Sulistyo, head of Indonesia’s National Search and Rescue Agency, said a search team found the plane's emergency exit at 12.40pm, local time, and confirmed it came from the missing plane. At 1.25pm, further objects were found in the waters, which are apparently about 80 to 100 feet deep.
Mr Sulistyo said the debris is being recovered and taken back to shore at the ton of Pangkalan Bun to be examined. Twenty-one naval and rescue divers are being sent to the area. He said heavy weather is hampering the search.
07.45 Preparing for the grim reality:
07.40 Debris sighted is the emergency exit door, says Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency. The chief says he's 95 per cent sure the flotsam is from the Airbus. The waters where the objects have been found are not deep, the team estimate about 80-100ft.
07.38 Indonesia's director general of civil aviation Djoko Murjatmodjo says: "Based on the observation by search and rescue personnel, significant things have been found, such as a passenger door and cargo door. It's in the sea, 100 miles southwest of Pangkalan Bun," he said, referring to the town in Central Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo.
07.30 Distraught family members are being called in to meet officials
07.18 A navy chief spokesman says "crew had visual of people at sea surface, not far from debris". He says he is also checking whether anyone is still alive. The waters in the Java Sea are fairly warm, but it has been more than 40 hours since the crash.
07.12 It seems to have been confirmed. Debris is "from AirAsia plane", Indonesian civil aviation chief says. "For the time being it can be confirmed that it's the AirAsia plane and the transport minister will depart soon to Pangkalan Bun," Djoko Murjatmodjo said.
07.00 Distressing news, but Jakarta-based Kompas TV has said that the co-pilot of an Indonesian air force C130 Hercules is reporting floating objects resembling humans, suitcases, buoys and aircraft debris. A reminder - this is all siz miles from where AirAsia flight QZ8501 was last logged on radar. Airborne search teams are naturally concerned that the debris could be moved by the current in the time it takes one of the ships to reach it.
06.50 It is nearly 2pm in Indonesia, and the sun sets around 6pm, so they have a little time to try to get search ships to the area and gather the debris to analyse.
06.46 For reference, this is what an Airbus 320 emergency slide looks like:
06.45 "The debris is red and white," Djoko Murjatmodjo, acting director general of air transportation at the transportation ministry, told reporters. "We are checking if it's debris from the aircraft. It's probably from the body of the aircraft."
06.38 BREAKING: An Indonesian transport ministry official says debris found in waters near Borneo is likely from Flight QZ8501. The Acting Director General of Transport Murjatmodjo also says he "strongly suspects fragments are part of AirAsia plane."
06.15 The AFP photographer on board the search flight has the taken the clearest photos yet of the debris:
06.05 “These look like items that are not usually seen on sea surface,” Indonesian air force official Agus Dwi Putranto has said.
06.00 Items resembling an emergency slide, plane door and other objects were spotted during an aerial search Tuesday for missing AirAsia flight 8501, Indonesian officials said.
"We spotted about 10 big objects and many more small white-coloured objects which we could not photograph," Indonesian air force official Agus Dwi Putranto told a press conference. "The position is 10 kilometres (six miles) from the location the plane was last captured by radar," he said.
He displayed 10 photos of objects resembling a plane door, emergency slide, and a square box-like object.
An AFP photographer on the same flight that spotted the debris said he had seen objects in the sea resembling a life raft, life jackets and long orange tubes.
05.35 This just in: Items resembling an emergency slide and a plane door have been spotted in AirAsia search, according to Indonesia and as reported by AFP. The debris is said to be to be seen 105 nautical miles from Pangkalan Bun. Jonathan Pearlman, our correspondent in Jakarta, has this:
Quote The search authority has confirmed that an object believed to be from the plane has been spotted in the south-west area of the search zone. It was spotted at 10.15am, local time, apparently by a plane from the National Search and Rescue Agency. An agency official told me that a fisherman spotted the object and reported it to the agency, which sent a plane to investigate. Apparently, they saw numerous objects including what appeared to be a flashing light. They are attempting to retrieve the objects now.05.12 Our correspondent in Surabaya, Tom Phillips, has just been to a press conference with the families. He says they will be flown over the search area tomorrow on a specially chartered Airbus 320 - the same plane as the QZ8051. "They believe their presence, their praying, will help the search and rescue to quickly find the aircraft', the AirAsia Indonesia chief says.
04.20 Officials have said the sea in the general search area was only 150 to 300 feet deep, which would be a help in finding the plane.
"The Java Sea area where they are now searching isn't even an ocean, it's more of an inland sea," Erik van Sebille, a physical oceanographer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney told Reuters.
"It's so shallow that they may just be able to spot the plane," said van Sebille, noting that sunlight travels through water up to about 100 metres.
Oceanographer Pattiaratchi said debris would normally be expected to float on the surface for around 18 days before sinking.
USS Sampson, the American warship on its way to help with the search:
04.05 In answer to our earlier question: why are planes still not fitted with the necessary technology to help find them if they lose contact with ground control? Wall Street Journal is reporting that AirAsia had adopted dedicated tracking technology but the QZ8501 had not been upgraded yet:
04.00 Unfortunately the search area only seems to be getting bigger, not smaller, as the hours pass:
02.50 The cause of the smoke could be any number of factors so should be treated with caution. One aviation expert has an alternate theory as to what is causing it:
