1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons butter
4 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups milk
8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (2 cups)
3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced*
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh broccoli
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
8 eggs
2 tablespoons milk
6 slices bacon, crisp-cooked, drained, and crumbled
1 large tomato, chopped

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a medium saucepan cook onion in butter over medium heat for 4 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in flour, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper. Stir in milk; cook and stir until slightly thickened and bubbly. Stir in cheese until melted.
2. In a 3-quart baking dish, layer potatoes, then cheese sauce. Bake, covered, about 55 minutes, until potatoes are tender.
3. In a large skillet, cook broccoli in hot oil over medium heat for 5 minutes, until nearly tender, stirring frequently. In a large bowl, beat together eggs, water, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper. Pour over broccoli in skillet. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on bottom and around edges. Using a spatula, lift and fold partially cooked egg so uncooked portion flows underneath. Cook 2 minutes more or until egg is cooked yet still moist.
Spoon over potatoes. Top with bacon and chopped tomato. Serve immediately.
