WE can't keep up with all the engagements happening at the moment.

And it seems that there could be another one to add to our list.

Sean Penn has reportedly popped the question to Charlize Theron.

The I Am Sam actor is said to have proposed while on a romantic trip to Paris in November.

US sources claimed that the 54-year-old was keen to take his relationship with the mum-of-one to the next level.

A source added that Charlize isn't yet wearing a ring to symbolise their union.

They said: "There's no ring, but they are committed."

The pair have been friends for a long time but only became romantically involved last year.

It will be the third time Sean has walked down the aisle. He was previously married to Madonna and split from second wife Robin Wright in 2010.

The couple had two children together, Hopper and Dylan.
