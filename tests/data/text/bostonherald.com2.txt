Chrome Industries' Mini Buran laptop messenger bag ($140) is a good investment for anyone who needs a sturdy bag that is built to last and can contain all of your stuff, whether it be a thin laptop or iPad. There are also small pockets for lighter objects.

There are four pockets in the front under the flap, a large pocket inside and a hidden lined pocket where a thin laptop or iPad and rest safe and snugâ€‹. This bag is large enough to carry a lot of stuff, but not bulky.

Seemingly indestructible, the bag features a seatbelt-buckle strap that grips your body nice and tight, but is ridiculously easy to get on and off.
