So how did Chris and Whitney sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G turn into us imagining their babies? We first got whiff of their whirlwind romance when she got a 1-on-1 date in Des Moines, the final destination before Hometowns. Their romantic evening included a stroll along the Des Moines River Walk followed by dinner at a downtown hotspot. After picking the lobster from their teeth, the duo kissed awkwardly in front of a mural some production assistants who are rethinking their career choices painted of the couple.



Apparently the alley makeout sesh wasn’t as awkward as it seemed, because Chris gifted Whit a rose, for which she gifted him a trip to her favorite Chicago Italian restaurant, Quartino, during their Hometown Date. All must have gone swimmingly, because she then (presumably) has all her fantasies come true in the Fantasy Suite in Bali.



Prince Farming narrows it down to two, taking Whit and one other lucky lady back to… Iowa! Apparently he leads the two final gals to a barn where things go the way of Children of the Corn for the other gal but get all Field of Dreams happy for Whitney.



Chris proposes, Whitney says yee haw, and the two ride off on a tractor into the sunset together. Way to get it, girl!



Are you surprised Whitney is the last woman standing? Tell us below.
