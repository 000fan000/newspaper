A power outage at Stansted International Airport in London held up holiday travel Monday afternoon, adding some extra misery to an already busy travel week.

The power outage lasted about two hours. Photos uploaded by holiday travelers show massive queues, although the outage affected only parts of the airport.

The power outage is affecting the transit system that gets travelers to their airplanes, according to the airport.

Stansted is located about 40 miles north of London's center; the terminal most affected is Ryanair.

Planes on the tarmac were also affected, as passengers had to wait because of the outage. The airport was dispatching buses to take passengers back and forth.

The airport reported that crews had restored power at about 5:30 p.m. local time (12:30 p.m. EST).

While much smaller than Heathrow or Gatwick airports in London, Stansted had its busiest November in eight years last month with more than 1.5 million passengers.

Stansted Airport reported that there were some delays, but flights are operating. FlightAware was not reporting a large number of delays in the early afternoon.
