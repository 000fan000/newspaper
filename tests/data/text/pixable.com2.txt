It’s hard to believe, but 2014 has come to an end and for better or worse 2015 is right around the corner. In 2014 we had some highs and some lows, but all in all it was an okay year. That being said there are still some pop culture trends that should never see the light of day again once the clock strikes midnight on December 31st.Don’t find yourself getting caught up in these trends we hope will stay behind once we move into 2015.The first “Sharknado” was okay. The second “Sharknado” was absurd and undoubtedly any other movies that have “Sharknado” in the title will be downright obnoxious.Yes, for the most part they’re fun to watch and make us think, but enough is enough. Some of these so-called social experiments are clearly staged and use innocent people for the sake of going viral.Yaaaaaaaaas we really do need to stop saying bae.Remember when Justin Bieber thought it was a good idea to revisit the 90s boyband era? Hopefully he gets some hair dye for Christmas and dyes it any other color but bleach blonde.We thought with the release of a new single off of Taylor Swift’s new album that we were done with the massive amounts of “Shake It Off” parodies, but it looks like we were wrong. Maybe next year we can pick a different song?Yes, “Frozen” was an excellent movie, but it’s time to let it go.For those who don’t know what normcore is it’s a fashion trend where people wear average looking clothing or whatever they can find. This contributes greatly to the next pop culture trend we hope stays in 2014.Where did this term even come from and why are we using it to describe average people who just happen to like everything in a non-ironic way?Cats are absolutely adorable — well sometimes — but it’s time for a new animal to take over the Internet in 2015. Goats maybe?“Peter Pan Live!” received a 59 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, which surprisingly was better than the 44 percent that “The Sound of Music Live!” received after it’s failed attempt to win over a large television audience.There was Solange, Beyonce and Jay Z and every time that Selena Gomez unfriended anyone of her famous friends and most recently the ongoing feud between Azealia Banks and Iggy Azalea. These are prime examples of celebrity drama that should be kept behind closed doors and does not need to be broadcast over the Internet.Kale was all the rage this past year, but it’s time for everyone to put down the vegetable and try some new leafy greens.‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians” was so last year. Ever since Bruce and Kris called it quits, Kylie and Kendall grew up and Kourtney had yet another baby we just can’t seem to care about what the Kardashians are up to.It seems like everywhere you turn there’s a hashtag. Every TV show has one, Facebook has tried to incorporate them into their platform, they appear on clothing and as home decor. Please stop abusing the hashtag.Why does Hollywood feel the need to remake classics like “Annie,” “Godzilla” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles”? They rarely do as well as the originals.
