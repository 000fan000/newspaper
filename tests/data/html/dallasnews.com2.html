		<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believe that Conservatives always paint themselves as victims. President Obama bullies the GOP Congress; Christians are victims because people wish them &quot;Happy Holiday&quot;; when Conservatives are criticized for racist comments they complain that their &quot;free speech&quot; has been victimized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The co-mingling line is offensive. Period. It exposes you as someone who lacks tolerance. You really need a Cootie shot or something...&lt;/span&gt;</description>

		<description>I wrote this to precisely trap a liberal fool.  Nothing in the post can be construed to be engendered by right or left.  Naturally, a liberal jumps to the conclusion he is a victim.  Nothing ever changes.</description>

		<description>We already live in a caste system.  There are a lot of families that wouldn&#039;t think of allowing their children to belittle themselves by serving in the Armed Forces in defense of their country.  And of course athletics is another problem because it forces children to think in terms of winning and losing when we all know everyone deserves a trophy, and wars are not be be won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a caste system already in football with potential performance measured up front by the Wonderlic test.  It ranges from quarterbacks in the 30 range (Romo 37 and Stafford 38 which is right up there with engineers and chemists) to single digits in other positions which rank below janitors at 14.  There was even a study which indicated that the higher the score was for some positions, the less desirable they may be for draft purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Football is just one of the ways we are no longer the country we once were.  We just lost an orthopedic surgeon named Jimmy Swink who was a TCU All American in the days getting a college scholarship meant getting an education a lot of other people wouldn&#039;t get.  College football has since evolved into an NFL farm team model where attending class is an unfortunate, mind numbing byproduct you and your mentor just have to put up with to stay on the team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have achieved Rome&#039;s greatness with the military machine, highways, architecture, government, and of course the bread and circuses.     TANF, EBT, Section 8, Free Cell Phones, Obamacare, et al gives us the Bread and Football and MMA the gladiators.  You don&#039;t have to read up on Gibbon to see the parallels between the Decline phase of the first superpower and the process currently underway within the former superpower.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

		<description>maybe we need to relook at how the game is structured today. maybe they should return to one platoon football where players are on both offense and defense. no more specialization. &lt;br /&gt;many studies have shown that as equipment has been improved players believe that they are more invunerable to serious injuries especially head injuries. have playing techniques changed? are players being taught the correct way to tackle?&lt;br /&gt;I would much prefer to see middle and high school youths play rugby than football. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

		<description>I encourage more parents to consider pulling their children from football activities.  That way my kids will have less competition for football scholarships.</description>

		<description>Yeah sure-- Conservatives always see themselves as victims like in the War on Christmas or the anti-abortion battle. Right thinking parents will keep their children away from Conservatives who must be brain damaged from all that football playing. What &lt;span&gt;parent wants his child co-mingled with those who will eventually claim victim status on all social issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Does Obamacare even cover Conservative Football Cooties?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

		<description>Certainly, today&#039;s parent does not want his child co-mingled with those who will eventually claim victim status on all social issues.  The exposure to these types makes no sense.</description>
